#### Architecting, Designing, and Deploying on the Snowflake Data Cloud

From day one, Snowflake has had an audacious vision to deliver high performance data management at massive scale — agnostic to the underlying cloud platform and architectural pattern. This comprehensive guide will walk you step-by-step through important principles and show you (with SQL examples and knowledge checks) how to unlock your data to power high-performant data applications and modern data analytics.

“Snowflake: The Definitive Guide” written by Joyce Kay Avila, a certified Snowflake and Data Superhero with more than 25 years of experience as a business and technology leader. She is currently the Snowflake practice manager for a Snowflake partner consulting firm.

In this book, you’ll discover what makes the Snowflake Data Cloud unique and gain insights and hands-on knowledge that allow you to explore the art of possibilities with Snowflake. You’ll learn how Snowflake users can build modern integrated data applications and develop new revenue streams based on data. Using hands-on SQL examples, you’ll also discover how the Snowflake Data Cloud helps you accelerate data science by avoiding replatforming or migrating data unnecessarily.

You’ll be able to:

Efficiently capture, store, and process large amounts of data at an amazing speed
Ingest and transform real-time data feeds in both structured and semistructured formats and deliver meaningful data insights within minutes
Use Snowflake Time Travel and zero-copy cloning to produce a sensible data recovery strategy that balances system resilience with ongoing storage costs
Securely share data and reduce or eliminate data integration costs by accessing ready-to-query datasets available in the Snowflake Marketplace
