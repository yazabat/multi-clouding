# Hugo + Netlify + GoDaddy
## _How to create a Hugo Website


Hugo is a potent static website creator created in the GO programming language. You may use it to construct uncluttered, up-to-date websites with minimum overhead that load rapidly.

- Buying a domain in [GoDaddy]
- Downloading your favorite hugo theme in local repository with [Github]
- Deploying the website in [Netlify]
- Magic âœ¨


You generally don't want to spend a lot of time building a website that will be straightforward and content-driven. If you're building a personal portfolio, business website, or blog, this might be the case.

## What is Hugo?

With the help of Hugo, a static site generator, you can create a website with little to no coding. You can typically write your content in a basic markup language, like Markdown, using static site generators.

Your content is subsequently transformed into static HTML files by the static site generator. Before serving up your pages to the user, it applies any templates or styles.

Hugo offers a library of pre-built themes and website layouts that you may select from. Once a theme has been downloaded, you can begin creating your content. Hugo allows you to write information in a variety of formats.
